			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>The redesign of the website for BlacktipH Fishing is to reorganize the content, create a more dynamic and usable design, increase web traffic, and to create an overall professional experience for the visitors. The website lacks design and creativity.</p>

			<p>The client doesn’t update their fishing reports page, so it would be best to eliminate them altogether. The “shark fishing” page and the “tips &amp; techniques” page are mostly embedded videos and can be eliminated until the client has more content to place on these pages. The YouTube tab on the navigation can be eliminated and replaced with a YouTube icon. The links page is not relevant to the show or their sponsors and therefore can be eliminated. In the “about us” dropdown menu, “our partners” doesn’t have to be it’s own page, they can put in a section on the home page.  The “in the media” does not need to be in a dropdown menu, rather it can be it’s own tab. Therefore the total pages of the website are reduced to six (6): Home, “About Us”, “Image Gallery”, Press, FAQ, and “Contact Us”. The logo will be in the top left along with a horizontal navigation menu. We will create a clean banner that is well branded.</p>
