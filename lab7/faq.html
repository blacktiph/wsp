			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<p>These are some of the most frequently asked questions that we receive from our viewers on YouTube.</p>

			<h3>General Questions</h3>
			<dl class="faqs">
				<dt>How often do you go fishing?</dt>
				<dd>We go as much as the good LORD allows to. We usually fish around specific tides and moons. Weather is always a huge factor.</dd>

				<dt>How often do you upload videos</dt>
				<dd>We try to upload a minimum of two videos per month.</dd>			
				<dt>Where are you fishing?</dt>
				<dd>On the East of Florida between Miami and Cape Canaveral.</dd>
			</dl>
				
			<h3>Shark Fishing Questions</h3>
			<dl class="faqs">
				<dt>Is it legal to fish for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>Yes, in the <a href="http://www.eregulations.com/florida/fishing/saltwater/pageFlip" title="Fishing regulations for the state of Florida">FWC Fishing Regulations</a>, shark fishing is permitted. Prohibited species must be released. Also <strong>Chapter 379.104</strong> of the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/" title="Florida state law">Florida Statutes</a> states: "<em>The Legislature recognizes that hunting, fishing, and the taking of game are a valued part of the cultural heritage of Florida and should be forever preserved for Floridians. The Legislature further recognizes that these activities play an important part in the state's economy and in the conservation, preservation, and management of the state's natural areas and resources. Therefore, the Legislature intends that the citizens of Florida have a right to hunt, fish, and take game, subject to the regulations and restrictions prescribed by general law and by s. 9, Art. IV of the State Constitution</em>." Also, <strong>Chapter 379.2351</strong> states: "<em>No commercial or recreational fishing operation shall be declared a public or private nuisance solely because of a change in ownership or a change in the character of the property in or around the locality of the operation. No local governing authority shall adopt any ordinance that declares any commercial or recreational fishing operation to be a nuisance solely because it is a commercial or recreational fishing operation, or any zoning ordinance that unreasonably forces the closure of any commercial or recreational fishing operation. Nothing in this act shall prevent a local government from regulating commercial and recreational fishing operations, including by requiring the use of methods, structures, or appliances where such use will prevent, ameliorate, or remove conditions which create or may create a nuisance or, pursuant to the applicable local zoning code, by declaring a commercial or recreational fishing operation to be a nonconforming use</em>." And also <strong>Chapter 379.2412</strong> states: "<em>The power to regulate the taking or possession of saltwater fish, as defined in s. 379.101, is expressly reserved to the state. This section does not prohibit a local government from prohibiting, for reasons of protecting the public health, safety, or welfare, saltwater fishing from real property owned by that local government</em>."</dd>

				<dt>Do you release your sharks?</dt>
				<dd>Yes, BlacktipH Fishing is very concerned about the declining shark populations and we make every effort to ensure the survival of every shark we catch. Not only do we release our sharks, but also make every effort to  place tracking tags in them, which contributes to important scientific research.</dd>

				<dt>What surf rod do you use for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>We use a custom 13ft Barrett spinning surf rod, rated 4-8oz.</dd>
				
				<dt>What spinning reel&#40;s&#41; do you use when fishing for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>We use a Fin-Nor OS9500ss and a Penn 950ssm.</dd>

				<dt>What conventional reels do you use when fishing for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>We use Duel 12/0w's with a T-Bar handle.</dd>
				
				<dt>What fishing line do you use on your spinning reels when fishing for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>We use 65lb braid on our spinning outfits.</dd>

				<dt>What fishing line do you use on your conventional reels when fishing for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>We spool our Duel's with 800yds of 200lb braid backing and have between 200-300yds of 200lb mono topshot.</dd>
				
				<dt>What brand of hooks do you use for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>This depends on what size sharks we are fishing for. For sharks in the 6-8ft range, we like to use <a href="http://eagleclaw.com/product/single/circle-sea-6" title="Eagle Claw circle hooks">Eagle Claw 12/0 Circle Sea L2004 hooks</a>. The Eagle Claw hooks are our favorite hooks for blacktips. For sharks over 8ft, we like to use <a href="http://www.lindgren-pitman.com/p-55-carbon-steel-circle-hook-180-black-10-offset-point-100-count.aspx" title="Lindgren Pitman circle hooks">Lindgren Pitman 18/0 circle hooks</a>. Josh believes that LP makes the best circle hook on the market for the price.</dd>
				
				<dt>How long is your leader when you are fishing for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>The rigs we use for casting in the surf are around 7ft. The rigs we use for larger sharks are 20ft. When fishing on a boat, use 6ft of #19 wire.</dd>
				
				<dt>What bait do you use for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>We like to use Bonito, Barracuda, Stingray, Jacks, Bluefish, and Ladyfish. Basically any oily and bloody fish makes a good bait.</dd>
				
				<dt>How do you remove the hook from the sharks mouth?</dt>
				<dd>We use either pliers or an Arc Dehooker to remove the hook. The best pliers are 16&#34; astro pneumatic needle nose pliers, which can be purchased at Walmart. If you do not know what an Arc DeHooker is, here is a link: <a href="http://www.dehooker4arc.com/" title="Arc DeHooker hook removal tool">http://www.dehooker4arc.com/</a>.</dd>
				
				<dt>What is the best time to fish for sharks?</dt>
				<dd>When we are fishing from shore, we prefer dawn&#40;morning&#410; and dusk&#40;evening&#41;. We do most our of boat shark fishing during the day.</dd>
				
				<dt>How do you get your shark baits out from shore?</dt>
				<dd>If we are fishing with surf fishing tackle, we will mostly likely be casting. If we are using large conventional, we use a kayak to deploy our baits.</dd>
				
				<dt>Where can I get shark tags?</dt>
				<dd>Visit this website: <a href="http://na.nefsc.noaa.gov/sharks/" title="Apex Predator shark tagging program">Cooperative Shark Tagging Program</a> or call this phone number: 877-826-2612.</dd>

				<dt>How much time needs to pass before you catch a shark?</dt>
				<dd>Everyday is different. On some days it takes less than five minutes to get a bite. On other days we never even get a bite.</dd>
