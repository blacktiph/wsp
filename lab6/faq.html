				<h3>General Questions</h3>
					<!-- Question --><dt>Do you release your sharks?</dt>
					<dd>Yes, BlacktipH Fishing is very concerned about the declining shark populations and we make every effort to ensure the survival of every shark we catch. Not only do we release our sharks, but also make every effort to  place tracking tags in them, which contributes to important scientific research.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>Is it legal to fish for sharks?</dt>
					<dd>Yes, in the <a class="two" href="http://myfwc.com/media/1068044/FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">FWC Fishing Regulations</a>, shark fishing is permitted. Prohibited species must be released. Also <span class="bold">Chapter 379.104</span> of the Florida Statutes states: "<span class="italic">The Legislature recognizes that hunting, fishing, and the taking of game are a valued part of the cultural heritage of Florida and should be forever preserved for Floridians. The Legislature further recognizes that these activities play an important part in the state's economy and in the conservation, preservation, and management of the state's natural areas and resources. Therefore, the Legislature intends that the citizens of Florida have a right to hunt, fish, and take game, subject to the regulations and restrictions prescribed by general law and by s. 9, Art. IV of the State Constitution</span>." Also, <span class="bold">Chapter 379.2351</span> of the Florida Statutes states: "<span class="italic">No commercial or recreational fishing operation shall be declared a public or private nuisance solely because of a change in ownership or a change in the character of the property in or around the locality of the operation. No local governing authority shall adopt any ordinance that declares any commercial or recreational fishing operation to be a nuisance solely because it is a commercial or recreational fishing operation, or any zoning ordinance that unreasonably forces the closure of any commercial or recreational fishing operation. Nothing in this act shall prevent a local government from regulating commercial and recreational fishing operations, including by requiring the use of methods, structures, or appliances where such use will prevent, ameliorate, or remove conditions which create or may create a nuisance or, pursuant to the applicable local zoning code, by declaring a commercial or recreational fishing operation to be a nonconforming use</span>." And also <span class="bold">Chapter 379.2412 - State preemption of power to regulate</span> of the Florida Statutes states: <span class="italic">he power to regulate the taking or possession of saltwater fish, as defined in s. 379.101, is expressly reserved to the state. This section does not prohibit a local government from prohibiting, for reasons of protecting the public health, safety, or welfare, saltwater fishing from real property owned by that local government</span>."</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>Where are you fishing?</dt>
					<dd>Our host, Joshua Jorgensen, has many fishing spots in both Ontario &amp; Florida. In Ontario, most of his fishing adventures occur on the Great Lakes. In Florida, on the Southeast Coast from Miami to Vero Beach.</dd>
				
				<h3>Shark Fishing</h3>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>What surf rod do you use for sharks?</dt>
					<dd>As of this moment, we currently use 13ft Breakaway HDX surf rod.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>What spinning reel&#40;s&#41; do you use when fishing for sharks?</dt>
					<dd>We use a Fin-Nor OS9500ss and a Penn 950ssm.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>What fishing line do you use on your spinning reels when fishing for sharks?</dt>
					<dd>We like to use 65lb Power Pro. It casts great and is very strong! 65lb Power Pro will actually break at around 80lbs.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>What brand of hooks do you use for sharks?</dt>
					<dd><div style="padding-bottom:10px; width:100%">This depends on what size sharks we are fishing for.</div> <div style="padding-bottom:10px; width:100%">If we are fishing for sharks in the 6-8ft range, we like to use <a class="two" href="http://www.eagleclaw.com/site/wp-content/uploads/PDF/LZ/Hooks.pdf" target="_blank">Eagle Claw 12/0 Circle Sea L2004 Hooks</a>. The Eagle Claw hooks are our favorite hooks for blacktip sharks. They are cheap and work great!</div> <div style="padding-bottom:10px; width=100%">For sharks over 8ft, we like to use <a class="two" href="http://www.lindgren-pitman.com/p-55-carbon-steel-circle-hook-180-black-10-offset-point-100-count.aspx" target="_blank">Lindgren Pitman 18/0 Carbon Steel Circle Hooks</a>. Pitmans are awesome, Josh believes they are the best circle hooks on the market. They are also one of the cheapest hooks, costing under $1.00. These hooks can be sharpened with an axe file to a knife point, sharper than any other hook. You can continue to sharpen these hooks, even after they completely rust.</div></dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>How long is your leader when you are fishing for sharks?</dt>
					<dd>The rigs we use for casting are around 7ft and our big-game &#40;kayaking&#41; rigs are between 15-20ft.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>What bait do you use for sharks?</dt>
					<dd>We like to use Bonito, Barracuda, Stingray, Jacks, Bluefish, and Ladyfish. Basically any oily and bloody fish makes a good bait.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>How do you remove the hook from the sharks mouth?</dt>
					<dd>We use either pliers or an Arc Dehooker to remove the hook. The best pliers are 16&#34; astro pneumatic needle nose pliers, which can be purchased at Walmart. If you do not know what an Arc DeHooker is, here is a link: <a class="two" href="http://www.dehooker4arc.com/" target="_blank">http://www.dehooker4arc.com/</a>.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>What is the best time to fish for sharks?</dt>
					<dd>We prefer to fish around dawn&#40;morning&#410; and dusk&#40;evening&#41;. If you are fishing from shore, your best opportunity to land a big shark is at night. This is because boat traffic is at a minimum. Many times though, big fish will bite at any time during the day.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>How do you get your shark baits out from shore?</dt>
					<dd>If we are fishing with surf fishing tackle, we will mostly likely be casting. If we are using large conventional and leverdrag reels, we use a kayak to bring the bait out.</dd>
				
					<!-- Question --><dt>Where can I get shark tags?</dt>
					<dd>Visit this website: <a href="http://na.nefsc.noaa.gov/sharks/" target="_blank">Cooperative Shark Tagging Program</a> or call this phone number: 877-826-2612.</dd>

				<h3>Joshua Jorgensen</h3>
				<img src="images/joshua_jorgensen.jpg" alt="Joshua Jorgensen is the host of the BlacktipH Fishing show" title="Host of BlacktipH Fishing" width="130" height="119" />
				<p>Joshua Jorgensen grew up in Windsor Ontario fishing on the Great Lakes. He has always been intrigued with catching the largest fish. As his hunt for big fish expanded, he moved to saltwater fishing in pursue of sharks and other large pelagic predators. He is the founder and director of the "Blacktip Challenge”, which is a land based shark fishing tournament held in Florida.</p>

				<p>Jorgensen is a lead committee member of the ILSFA (International Land-Based Shark Fishing Association). His fishing adventures have been featured in numerous media articles, including: Global Angler, Spiegel TV, Spiegel Magazine, Sun Newspapers and Living Magazine.</p>

				<p>Joshua received the LORD and was born of the Spirit of God. In his own words, “I love the LORD with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my mind, and with all my strength. He is my joy in this life and I couldn’t ask for anything else. His grace is sufficient for me. As much as I love to go fishing, my love for the LORD and His saints is far greater!”</p>
